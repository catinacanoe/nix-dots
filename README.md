readme for canoe's nix configuration

the below is no longer valid because I have switched from channel based config to flake.nix

# installation
  make sure `nix-channel --list` outputs the following:
  home-manager https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz
  nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable
  nixpkgs https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
