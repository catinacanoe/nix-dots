# basically "airpod" is the ID for this key, so that other doubletaps can run independently of this one
# 150 is the timeout, so the key presses must occur within 150ms of each other
# what follows is a list of commands to run, so on one tap: play/pause, two taps: next, three taps: prev etc

# calling doubletap with the same ID as previous call but different timeout is undefined behavior
